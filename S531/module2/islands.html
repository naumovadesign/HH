<p>
No man is an island,<br>
Entire of itself,<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
A part of the main.
</p>
<p>
If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less,<br>
As well as if a promontory were:<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend's<br>
Or of thine own were.
</p>
<p>
Any man's death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind.<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
It tolls for thee.
</p>
